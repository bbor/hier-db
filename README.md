# mix-db

An minimalist, indexed hierarchical data structure, used by the [typesmith](https://www.github.com/bbor/typesmith) and [mixtape](https://www.github.com/bbor/mixtape) projects.

## Usage

```js
var mixDb = require('mix-db');

// Create a new database
var db = mixDb();

// Add records to the database:
db.add(record_1);
db.add({
  'name':'record_2',
  'content':'some data',
  'another_field':'whatever'
});
db.add('an empty record that has only a long name');

// Set up a parent-child relationship
db.add_parent(record_1, record_2);

// Find a record by name
var record_by_name = db.find({'name':'whatever'});

// Get a record by UID
var record_by_uid = db.index['some_uid'];

// Get all data objects that are children/parents of another object
var children = db.children_of(record_by_uid);
var parents = db.parents_of(record_by_uid);
// or
var children = db.children_of('some_uid');
var parents = db.parents_of('some_uid');

// Get an array of all records
var all_records = db.all();

// Get all records at the topmost level of the hierarchy: i.e. records without other parents
var top_level = db.children_of(db.root);

``` 

## Structure

The database holds individual data records, each of which is a JavaScript object that must contain at minimum a `name` string. It can also contain any other keys and values you want.

### UIDs

For speedy lookups, each record you add to the database is indexed by a unique ID. You can create these UIDs yourself and store them in your data objects. If you add a record that doesn't already have a UID, `mix-db` will create one for you and save it on that record.

### Children and parents

Each record in the database can have any number of children, and any number of parents. This allows a given item to exist in multiple places within the hierarchy.

Internally, parent and child lists are stored as UIDs. This allows the database to be written out (e.g. to JSON) and read back in without duplicating any records, keeping the same parent-child relationships intact, even when a single record has multiple parents.

## Configuration settings

The `mix-db` structure makes some assumptions about what properties will be used to store the various items of information it needs about each record. For example, each record's UID is stored by default in the `uid` key of that object.

If any of these default keys conflict with data that you're storing in your objects for other reasons, you can configure the keys used for these fields.

The defaults are:

- `name`: Record names are read from the `name` key.
- `uid`: Unique IDs are stored in the `uid` key.
- `children`: The `children` key stores the list of each object's children, expressed as UIDs.
- `parent`: The `parent` key stores the list of each object's parents, expressed as UIDs.
- `disambiguate_by`: When you add a record to the database, its name is adopted as the UID. When you add a second record with the same name, a new UID needs to be generated. If the `disambiguate_by` list contains any strings, then the new UID will be generated by appending the value of each of these keys until a new unique ID is found. The default value is `['type']`.

  So, say you add the record `{'name':'log','type':'object'}`, it gets the UID `log`. Then, if you add another record that is `{'name':'log','type':'function'}`, the new record gets the UID `log_function`.

For example:

```js
var config = {
  'name':'identifier',
  'uid':'guid',
  'children':'stuff_i_own',
  'parents':'stuff_that_owns_me',
  'disambiguate_by':['alternate','keys']
}

var db = mixDb(config);
```


## Properties

## API

Use the following methods to add, remove and retrieve data in the database.

### .add (records, parent)

Adds one or more new records to the database.

- The `records` parameter can be:
  - a single data object that has a `name` field.
  - a string. A new object will be created with that string as its name.
  - an array of the above. Each item is added as a separate new record.
- If you provide a parent, the new record or records will get added under that parent. The parent parameter can be either the uid of another record, or the record itself. If you provide a parent, and it isn't already in the database, the parenting will fail. Any parents or children that are already present in the new record are kept.

### .remove (records, promote_orphans)

Removes one or more records from the database.

- The `records` parameter can be a UID string, the record object itself, or an array of those.
- The `promote_orphans` parameter determines what happens to children of the removed parent. By default, orphaned records are removed along with the parent. Set this to `true` to have the orphans reparented to become children of the removed record's parents.

### .add_parent (child, parent, clear_existing)

Adds a new parent-child relationship between two existing database records. Note that this function fails if either record is not in the database already!

- The `child` parameter is the record you want to reparent.
- The `parent` parameter is the new parent you want for that child record.
- The `clear_existing` parameter determines whether or not any existing parents of the child element should be removed first. If `true`, all existing parents are removed, so the new parent will be the only parent for the child. If `false`, any existing parents are kept, which may result in the child having multiple parents and existing in multiple places in the hierarchy (which may not be what you're expecting). Default value is `false`.

### .remove_parent (child, parent)

Removes the parent-child relationship between the two specified records, if any exists.

### .children_of (record)

Returns the array of all children under the specified record.

### .parents_of (record)

Returns an array of all parents that own the specified record.

### .filter (predicate)

Returns an array of all elements in the database that satisfy the given predicate.

This function is a thin wrapper around the [Lodash .filter function](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.5#filter), so it accepts any predicate you could use there.

### .find (predicate)

Returns the first element in the database that satisfies the given predicate.

This function is a thin wrapper around the [Lodash .find function](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.5#find), so it accepts any predicate you could use there.

### .all()

Returns all indexed records as an array.

### .resolve (records)

Returns one or more database records (or the root node) based on their UIDs. Mostly intended for internal use.

The records parameter can be a single string UID, a single object, or an array of strings an objects.
